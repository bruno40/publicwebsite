<h1>Seriously Fruity (yet sugar free) Mincemeat recipe</h1>

<pref>
I thought I'd share with you my favourite Mincemeat recipe which is fat and sugar free - sadly still high in carbs due to the dried fruit but still a lot more diabetic friendly than anything you can usually buy plus its ready to use in 30 mins. Here you go......

Seriously Fruity (yet sugar free) Mincemeat

75 g Dried apricots, chopped
75 g Chopped (unsweetened) dates
75 g Sultanas
75 g Raisins
12 prunes stoned and chopped (approx 75g)
6 dried figs chopped
30 g almonds, chopped
2 apples peeled, cored and thinly sliced (eating apples eg coxes - not green)
125 ml Brandy
Juice of half a lemon
Rind of half an orange
2 tbsp Orange or Apple Juice
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp Freshly grated nutmeg (or ground)
1/4 tsp Ground Ginger
1/4 tsp Allspice
Alternatively, instead of the 4 separate spices add one tsp of mixed spice.

I snip the large fruit with a pair of scissors for ease but watch your finger tips!!
Pop all the ingredients into a medium sized saucepan and bring to a low simmer. Cook gently stirring occasionally until the apple softens takes about 5 to 8 mins (it won't break down like a cooking apple). Cool a little before making the pies or keep in the fridge for up to two weeks (will also freeze for a couple of months if required).

To make into low fat mince pies use a large sheet of filo pastry, brush with a little melted butter or spray with a flavourless oil or light olive oil.
Cut into squares (make sure the square are big enough to fit into your shallow bun tin with a bit extra to spare).
Place 2 squares one on top of each other so you make an 8 pointed star into each bun hollow in your tin (make sure you have lighty oiled it or use a silicone tray) pop a spoon of mincemeat into each star and top with another square of filo and press down a little to seal the edges.
Bake for 10 to 15 mins in a moderate oven about 180 C. Serve warm.
They do reheat quite well but don't over bake as the filo burns easily.

Enjoy :) :) :)

I also have a great recipe for a fat free, sugar free, dairy free (but not enjoyment free) fruit cake that makes a great substitute for traditional Christmas Cake I'll post it when I've dug it out of my recipes.
